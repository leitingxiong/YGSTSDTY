1. The Game System currently included:
+ Gacha System:
- Has 1-time button and 10-timebutton.
- UI Panel contains ratios.

+ Craft System:
- The materials gotten from Gacha System can be used here.
- You can create your own recipe.

+ Shop System:
- You can switch between them to buy anything within limited attempt.
- However, it does not include in-app purchase or watching ads to buy.

+ Inventory System:
- The equipment bought from Shop System or created from Craft System will appear here.
- You can drag and drop these equipment that fit the equipment slot, otherwise it will turn back to the inventory. (*) But it doesn't increase player stats.
- There're also the delete button allowing to to delete the item.
- You can unequip item. The inventory field that allows you to unequip will display when you hoding item.
- Stackable and unstackable item.
(**) Does not have function of using stackable item (HP Potion, MP Potion). I tend to update in the future as it involves in player stats.
(*) and (**) I will update in the future.

+ Upgrade System (Under Development)
- The equiping item will be displayed in this system.
- This system includes 2 functions: upgrade and transfer.
- The upgrade function is used for upgrade level of equipment.
- The transfer function is for transfering level of 2 equipments.

Make sure that the package is not using anything like special APIs, database, addresable, event system ..., which I believe that is in the higher level. All the function is using code with some UI Component like (Toggle, Grid Layout, Button, TextMeshPro,...) . Tell me if there is any bugs.
